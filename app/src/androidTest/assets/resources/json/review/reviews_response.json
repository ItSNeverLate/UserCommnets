      "message": "We loved Tempelhof, my 10yr old thought it was fantastic and probably one of his highlights of Berlin. The guide was brilliant and gave lots of information on both the history and the architecture. I would recommend this tour to anyone, however there is a lot of walking and most of it is up and down stairs, so make sure you’re able to manage it before booking.",

Some recommendations for improvement: The group was too big Many black and white paper print images have been featured and can now be viewed simply on a tablet or in more advanced ways We would also like to tour the rest of this large building The tour focused on a very small part of the building",

You get to see a whole lot of the airport and learn lots about its history and future. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and detailed in his explanations. He walked us through the entire tour with ease and efficiency. It was a rather long tour, but not one minute of it I was bored. It was very interesting. Definitely recommend.",
